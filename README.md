# A simple interpreter, named "finger"

## Background

This is a simple interpreter for the finger language, which is a simple language for describing the structure of a program. The idea is from "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball.

## Target

Based on the book, I want to implement that interpreter liked the interpreter of JavaScript by JavaScript Enigne.

Maybe I will do it in the future.

## GC

Currently, I don't implement GC. Just use the GoLang's GC.
