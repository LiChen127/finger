# A simple interpreter, named "finger"

## Background

This is a simple interpreter, I called it "finger", which is a simple language for describing the structure of a program.
The idea is from "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball.

## Current work

At current time, this project has been implemented as a simple language, which can be used to describe the structure of a program.

## Future work

I will add more features to the language, make it more powerful, implement it liked a real language, not a "project from learning".

### Target

Maybe like JavaScript

1. make it become the OOP
2. make it become the functional programming
3. I/O (file, net, database) anyway
